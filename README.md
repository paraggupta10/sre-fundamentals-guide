# 🚀 SRE Fundamentals Guide

A comprehensive learning journey through Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) fundamentals, focusing on practical knowledge and real-world applications.

## 📋 Overview

This repository documents my structured approach to mastering SRE concepts, from foundational system knowledge to advanced reliability practices. Each topic is thoroughly researched, documented, and connected to practical SRE scenarios.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- **Understand SRE Principles**: Core concepts, error budgets, and reliability practices
- **Master Monitoring & Observability**: Four Golden Signals, SLOs/SLIs, alerting strategies
- **System Fundamentals**: Linux internals, boot processes, and infrastructure understanding
- **Incident Response**: Procedures, postmortems, and continuous improvement
- **Automation & Tooling**: Infrastructure as Code, monitoring setup, and operational efficiency
