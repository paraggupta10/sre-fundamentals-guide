## ‚úÖ Resolved Questions

### What are the core principles of Site Reliability Engineering?
**Resolved Date:** 2025-01-07  
**Original Question:** What makes SRE different from traditional operations?

**Answer/Solution:**
SRE applies software engineering principles to operations problems. Core principles include:
- Embracing risk through error budgets
- Eliminating toil through automation
- Monitoring everything with meaningful metrics
- Simplicity in system design and operations
- Blameless postmortem culture

**Sources:**
- [Google SRE Book - Introduction](https://sre.google/sre-book/introduction/)
- [Google SRE Book - Embracing Risk](https://sre.google/sre-book/embracing-risk/)

**Key Insights:**
- SRE is fundamentally about treating operations as a software problem
- Error budgets provide a quantitative framework for balancing reliability and velocity
- Automation is preferred over manual processes wherever possible

### What are the stages of Linux boot process and why is this important for SRE?
**Resolved Date:** 2025-09-07  
**Original Question:** How does a Linux system start up and what should SREs know about this process?

**Answer/Solution:**
The Linux boot process consists of 6 main stages: BIOS ‚Üí MBR ‚Üí GRUB ‚Üí Kernel ‚Üí Init ‚Üí Runlevel Programs. Understanding this is crucial for SREs because:

1. **Troubleshooting**: When systems fail to boot, knowing each stage helps isolate the problem
2. **Performance**: Understanding boot sequence helps optimize startup times
3. **Recovery**: Knowledge of boot process is essential for system recovery procedures
4. **Monitoring**: Can set up monitoring for boot-related metrics and failures
5. **Automation**: Understanding init systems helps with service management and automation

**Sources:**
- [The Geek Stuff - Linux Boot Process](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/02/linux-boot-process/)

**Key Insights:**
- Each stage has specific failure modes that require different troubleshooting approaches
- Modern systems may use systemd instead of traditional init, but the overall concept remains
- Container environments abstract this but understanding the underlying process is still valuable
