# SRE Fundamentals Guide

## 🎯 Project Goal
Build a comprehensive understanding of Site Reliability Engineering fundamentals including monitoring, incident response, SLOs/SLIs, and reliability practices. This project aims to create a practical knowledge base that bridges theory with hands-on implementation.

## 📊 Current Status
**Status:** Initial Setup Complete | **Progress:** 10% | **Last Updated:** 2025-01-07

Project structure has been established and ready for content development. Initial research phase beginning with focus on foundational SRE concepts and best practices.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- [ ] Research and collect foundational SRE resources (Google SRE books, key articles)
- [ ] Create structured notes on SLO/SLI concepts and best practices
- [ ] Set up hands-on lab environment for practicing monitoring tools
- [ ] Document incident response procedures and runbooks
